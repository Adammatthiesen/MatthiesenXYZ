        This website is the Hub of my various projects, as well as a single place for me to show off what makes me who I am.  Ever since I was a small kid I have migrated towards technology over sports, card games, and other normal 2000 era kid stuff.
        After years of showing intrest in technology I built my first computer with my Dad at the age of Five.  After that I continued into learning more about the computer at my hands, it started simnple as gaming, then running Minecraft servers, and eventually...
        on to more complicated projects, that led me to my first IT job working as a Help Desk Technician at, Your Business Solutions, INC. in Texas Remote from my home in Washington at the age of 19.
