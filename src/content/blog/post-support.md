### Release Date: TBD

This project is intended to become my new IT Support Center & Help Desk for me to run for both local & remote small businesses, as well as some home individuals.

*I do intend to offer limited OpenSource Customer support for issues related to my blog or knowledge base on the support center, but unless you setup a **Service Contract** I may not be able to assist you in a manner that is sufficient.*

I will also be created a Basic setup tutorial that I will link below when it is ready,  As well as a Tutorial for setting up the billing/invoice system I am using... both the links are below.

- Tutorial: [osTicket OpenSource - Setup Tutorial](#)
- Tutorial: [SolidInvoice - Setup Tutorial](/blog/tutorial-solidinvoice)

## Project Check-Ins

### Dec. 23rd 2023

- I ended up having to give up with UVDesk, as it had issues with emails.  Installed and setup osTicket in a breeze.  Will create a docker tutorial antoher day.  but for now its working.
- Further testing and integration into new site feature. *The Get Support Button on the Sidebar that leads to a contact form*
- Website form integration is using [UseBasin](https://usebasin.com) which pipes using email into osTicket.  Simplifying osTicket's integration into my website for a front end *Managed* ticket filter.  Tickets are presented to the Agent from the usebasin email instead of the users email, allowing quick identication of the Webform based tickets.
- Soldinvoice configuration stands as is with no issues.

### Dec. 18th 2023

- Setup Soldinvoice as a billing system, now I just need to figure out the rest of the tweaking for UVDesk then everything will be ready for finalization.

### Dec. 17th 2023

- Initial Deployment and basic configuration, took 3 tries... more documentation to come... please do not try to use the support center as I am still working out the bugs and it may not function as intended.
