### Release Date: T.B.D.

This project is intended to become my new IT Support Center & Help Desk for me to run for both local & remote small businesses, as well as some home individuals. 

*I do intend to offer limited OpenSource Customer support for issues related to my blog or knowledge base on the support center, but unless you setup a **Service Contract** I may not be able to assist you in a manner that is sufficient.*

I will also be created a Basic setup tutorial that I will link below when it is ready,  As well as a Tutorial for setting up the billing/invoice system I am using... both the links are below.

- Tutorial: [UVDesk OpenSource - Setup Tutorial](#)
- Tutorial: [SolidInvoice - Setup Tutorial](/blog/tutorial-solidinvoice)

## Update Checkins:

### Dec. 18th 2023:
- Setup Soldinvoice as a billing system, now I just need to figure out the rest of the tweaking for UVDesk then everything will be ready for finalization.

### Dec. 17th 2023:
- Initial Deployment and basic configuration, took 3 tries... more documentation to come... please do not try to use the support center as I am still working out the bugs and it may not function as intended.
