### Release Date: Jan, 1, 2024

This project is intended to become my new IT Support Center & Help Desk for me to run for both local & remote small businesses, as well as some home individuals.

*I do intend to offer limited OpenSource Customer support for issues related to my blog or knowledge base on the support center, but unless you setup a **Service Contract** I may not be able to assist you in a manner that is sufficient.*

Below are links to the relevent Tutorials that are used to create my support system.  The only thing I am not including is how I configured them to link together with my website so that my workflow works for my setup.  As each setup is different and has different requirements each user will have different requirements.

## Project Check-Ins

### Dec. 25th 2024

- Hi, I just wanted to update "everyone" today for Christmas of 2023, **MERRY CHRISTMAS** from the MatthiesenXYZ Family!  I will be launching the support system at the beginning of 2024!

### Dec. 23rd 2023

- I ended up having to give up with UVDesk, as it had issues with emails.  Installed and setup osTicket in a breeze.  Will create a docker tutorial antoher day.  but for now its working.
- Further testing and integration into new site feature. *The Get Support Button on the Sidebar that leads to a contact form*
- Website form integration is using [UseBasin](https://usebasin.com) which pipes using email into osTicket.  Simplifying osTicket's integration into my website for a front end *Managed* ticket filter.  Tickets are presented to the Agent from the usebasin email instead of the users email, allowing quick identication of the Webform based tickets.
- Soldinvoice configuration stands as is with no issues.

### Dec. 18th 2023

- Setup Soldinvoice as a billing system, now I just need to figure out the rest of the tweaking for UVDesk then everything will be ready for finalization.

### Dec. 17th 2023

- Initial Deployment and basic configuration, took 3 tries... more documentation to come... please do not try to use the support center as I am still working out the bugs and it may not function as intended.
